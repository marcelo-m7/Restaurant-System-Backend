# Documentation Index

Canonical project documentation is kept at the repository root:

- `README.md` (project overview, quickstart, and testing)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (service boundaries, tenant propagation, and error contract)
- `DOMAIN.md` (domain entities, cardinalities, and golden rules)
- `SETUP.md` (development setup and local run model)

This `docs/` directory is reserved for future supplementary material (ADRs, diagrams, and implementation notes).
